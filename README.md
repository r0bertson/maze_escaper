# maze_escaper

### Finding a solution to a maze
Just pass your maze (as JSON) to `cmd/maze_escaper/main.go` like this:
```
cd cmd\maze_escaper
go run main.go "{\"forward\": \"exit\"}"
```


### Generating a random maze and it's solution
You can simply run `cmd/generate_maze/main.go` with its default params:
```
cd cmd\generate_maze
go run main.go
```

Or you can customize it passing the following arguments:
